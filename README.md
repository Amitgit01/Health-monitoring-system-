Project Title: "IoT-Based Health Monitoring System"

# Project Description:
The "IoT-Based Health Monitoring System" is designed to enable users to monitor their body vitals, such as blood pressure, sugar level, and heartbeat, and securely transmit the data to healthcare professionals remotely. The system utilizes IoT technologies to collect real-time health data, store it in a cloud platform, and provide a user-friendly interface for monitoring and analysis.

# Components:
Arduino/Genuino Board: The Arduino/Genuino board acts as the central control unit, responsible for data collection from various sensors and communication with the IoT platform.

Biometric Sensors: Biometric sensors such as blood pressure sensors, glucose meters, and heart rate sensors are used to capture the body vitals. Ensure the sensors you choose are compatible with Arduino and provide accurate readings.

Wi-Fi Module: A Wi-Fi module (e.g., ESP8266) is used to establish an internet connection and enable data transmission to the cloud platform.

IoT Cloud Platform: An IoT cloud platform, such as AWS IoT or Google Cloud IoT, is employed to store and manage the health data securely. It facilitates seamless communication between the Arduino board and the healthcare professionals' interface.

User Interface: A web or mobile application is developed to display the real-time health data to users and provide options to remotely send the data to healthcare professionals.

# Arduino Code and Functionality:

Initialize the necessary libraries and components.

Establish a Wi-Fi connection using the Wi-Fi module.

Continuously read data from the biometric sensors.

Send the sensor readings to the IoT cloud platform using MQTT or any suitable communication protocol for secure data transmission.

Implement data validation and error handling to ensure accurate and reliable data transfer.

Integrate the user interface with the IoT cloud platform to display the real-time health data.

Provide an option for users to securely send the data to healthcare professionals through the user interface.

Implement security measures, such as encryption and authentication, to protect the data during transmission and storage.
